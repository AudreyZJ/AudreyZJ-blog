Below is the problem statement for 'Recycled Numbers' from 'Google Code Jam - 2012':  <br /><blockquote><font color="green"> <br />Problem Statement<br />-----------------<br /><br />Do you ever become frustrated with television because you keep seeing the same things, recycled over and over again? Well I personally don't care about television, but I do sometimes feel that way about numbers. <br /><br />Let's say a pair of distinct positive integers (n, m) is recycled if you can obtain m by moving some digits from the back of n to the front without changing their order. For example, (12345, 34512) is a recycled pair since you can obtain 34512 by moving 345 from the end of 12345 to the front. Note that n and m must have the same number of digits in order to be a recycled pair. Neither n nor m can have leading zeros. <br /><br />Given integers A and B with the same number of digits and no leading zeros, how many distinct recycled pairs (n, m) are there with A ≤ n < m ≤ B?  Input -----  The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing the integers A and B.   Output ------  For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of recycled pairs (n, m) with A ≤ n < m ≤ B.  Limits ------  1 ≤ T ≤ 50. A and B have the same number of digits.   Small dataset -------------  1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1000.   Large dataset -------------  1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 2000000.    Sample Input ------------ 4 1 9 10 40 100 500 1111 2222  Sample Output -------------  Case #1: 0 Case #2: 3 Case #3: 156 Case #4: 287 </font><br /></blockquote><br /><br />For the above problem, a normal solution works for the small input datasets, but for larger input datasets, a bit of optimization has to be done. Below is the solution for the above problem, in Java.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/bchetty/5638702.js"></script>
