In a couple of Java projects with external jar files as dependencies, you can create an executable jar file by the following ways: 

<br /><br />

1) Include the sources of external libraries in your project and build them, as part of your project build process.<br /><br />
2) Unpack the jar file, pack them inside your project and create a single executable jar file. 

<br /><br />

For maven users, fortunately, there is "Maven Shade Plugin", which does the work for you, probably using the second option, as described above. Even if there wasn't a plugin, I guess, it ain't that difficult to build one. To use that plugin, all you have to do is to include the following <plugin> tag in your project's pom.xml:<br /><br /><br />
