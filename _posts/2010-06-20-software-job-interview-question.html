Today, I was searching for some technical articles and stumbled upon this interview question from Amazon, for which 
I could immediately think about some good solution. Here's the question: 

<br /><br />

{% highlight xml %}
We have numbers from 1 to 52 that are put into a 51 number array, what's the best way to find out which number is missing?
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

I read an answer from some guy, who said to sort the numbers first and then loop through and find the number. 
I thought that was inefficient way of doing that. My answer is as below:

<br /><br />

{% highlight xml %}
1) Calculate the sum of all numbers stored in the array of size 51

2) Subtract the sum from (52 * 53)/2 &amp;nbsp; -- Formula : n * (n+1)/2

The result of subtraction is the answer for this question.
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

Any other solutions that you know of?!?!?!
