Below is the problem statement of 'Odd Man Out' problem, from 'Google Code Jam 2010 (Africa)':<br /><blockquote><span style="color: green;"><br />Problem<br />-------<br /><br />You are hosting a party with G guests and notice that there is an odd number of guests! When planning the party you deliberately invited only couples and gave each couple a unique number C on their invitation. You would like to single out whoever came alone by asking all of the guests for their invitation numbers.<br /><br />Input<br />-----<br /><br />The first line of input gives the number of cases, N.<br />N test cases follow. For each test case there will be:<br /><br />One line containing the value G the number of guests.<br />One line containing a space-separated list of G integers. Each integer C indicates the invitation code of a guest.<br /><br />Output<br />------<br /><br />For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: " followed by the number C of the guest who is alone.<br /><br />Limits<br />------<br /><br />1 ≤ N ≤ 50<br />0 < C ≤ 2147483647  Small dataset -------------  3 ≤ G < 100  Large dataset -------------  3 ≤ G < 1000  Sample Input  ------------  3 3 1 2147483647 2147483647 5 3 4 7 4 3 5 2 10 2 10 5  Output ------  Case #1: 1 Case #2: 7 Case #3: 5 </span><br /></blockquote><br />Below is the solution coded by me in Java:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/bchetty/5639839.js"></script>
