<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
I am <b>Zhang, Audrey J</b>, currently living in Hong Kong. I have a Masters degree in 'Computer Science' from the University of Hong Kong, and have been developing R&D software applications, business software applications (both for work) and fun stuff (pet projects and other stuff for learning, etc) for more than 4 years. 
<br/><br/>

I  have always been fascinated with science & technology and am curious about many creative things.
I am also fascinated by different cultures and like to travel, experience it and understand the world in a better way. 
I want to use this website to capture/archive some of my work and to share that with others.
<br/><br/>

When I am not working, I am either reading up different stuff related to technology, world history, traveling or binge-watching TV shows on streaming services.
